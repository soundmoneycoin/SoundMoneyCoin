Sound Money Coin (SOV coin) is a sound money and a secure store of value. It's also the hardest money in existence - even harder then gold which is physically indestuctible. As the hardest money, Sound Money Coin is on an unstoppable trajectory to become a global reserve currency used by the poor and wealthy alike. Its transactions are settled on the Ethereum blockchain.

**If you understand the teachings of [Austrian Economics](https://mises.org/what-austrian-economics), logic will force you to conclude that SOV coin is the soundest of all moneys.**

In contrast to competing SOVs, mining of SOV coins is not restricted to the confines of Chinese factories. Anyone in the world can mint SOV at the cost of an Ethereum transaction. Supply is capped at 21 million. New coins can be minted only once per block and the minter receives 0.005 SOV. Each time new SOV are minted, 0.0001 SOV go into a fund for further development of the Sound Money Coin ecosystem.

## Why Sound Money Coin?

Government-controlled fiat money is the most devastating force in the Universe. By constantly printing money out of thin air, governments inflate the money supply which leads to high time preference in the population, world wars, Justin Bieber, the breeding of inexcusable aberrarions like the Sphinx and Pekingese, and ultimately the demise of mankind.

In the cryptocurrency space, some attempts have been made to create forms of digital gold with a pre-programmed monetary policy, but they have been plagued goverance issues and various forms of centralization. For instance, the Bitcoin protocol is subject to what could be called "soft Github governance": It is prone to changes by social consensus, which is easily manufactured by those in control of Bitcoin's stricly censored public relations channels. Realistically, all it to change Bitcoin's inflation rate is a ssoundmoneycoin.ioimple parameter change merged into its sole de-facto client implementation.

Not so Sound Mone yCoin. In contrast to traditional store of value cryptocurrencies, its monetary policy is enforced by an immutable smart contract that can never be changed. This makes Sound Money Coin an incredibly reliable store of value.

### The Hardest Money Always Wins

Now that the cat is out of the bag is no turning back. Inevitably, SOV will turn into the global reserve currency. Clever governments and entrepeneurs will get in sooner rather than later - those early adopters will be at the top of the new world order. Eventually however even the world's most backwards central banks will grudgingly buy Sound Money Coin reserves. Soon after, we will see the end of wars, the-emergence of beautiful science and art, and the crafting of spaceships that fly us to the furthest corners of the Universe.
